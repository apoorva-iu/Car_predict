Used Car Price Predictor ðŸš—

This project is a web application that predicts the selling price of used cars using a machine learning model deployed with Flask.

ðŸš€ Key Features
Interactive Web Form: Users input key car features (Company, Model, Year, Kms Driven, Fuel Type).

Dynamic UI: Car Models are dynamically filtered based on the selected Company using JavaScript.

ML Prediction: Price estimation is powered by a pre-trained regression model.

Project Structure
File/Folder	Purpose
app.py	Flask App: Core application logic, routing, and model serving.
templates/	Frontend: Contains index.html (the prediction form).
static/	Web Assets: Contains css/ for styling.
model.joblib	Prediction Model: The primary trained model file used by app.py.
LinearRegressionModel.pkl	Alternative format for the trained model.
Quikr Analysis.ipynb	Analysis: Jupyter Notebook detailing EDA, feature engineering, and model training.
quikr_car.csv	Raw Data: The original, uncleaned dataset.
Cleaned Car.csv	Cleaned Data: The processed dataset used for model training.
requirements.txt	Dependencies: Lists all necessary Python packages (Flask, scikit-learn, etc.).
